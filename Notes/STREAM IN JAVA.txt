COLLECTION:
=============
	TO REPRESENT THE GROUP OF OBJECTS INTO A SINGLE ENTITY THEN WE SHOULD GO FOR COLLECETION
	
STREAM:
============
	TO WORK WITH MULTIPLE OBJECTS  OR COLLECTION WE SHOULD GO FOR STREAM
	
	1. SOURCE:
	============
		on which you are appling the stream
	
	2. INTERMEDIATE operation:
	===========================
		the operation will return the another stream
		
	3. TERMINATION operation:
	==========================
		* it will terminate the stream
		* after applying the termination operation on stream  we cannot reuse it
		* for each stream we can use only one termination operation
		
	EXAMPLE:
	=========
	for multiple objects
			List<Integer> list = new ArrayList()'
			list.add(23);
			list.add(2);
			
			list.Stream().Filter(x ->x%2==0).Count()
			
		where:	
			list = source
			filter =intermediate operation
			count = termination operation
