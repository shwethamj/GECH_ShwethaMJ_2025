/*
C :
======
    low level programing language 
    procedure oriented
    uses functions,algorithm
    top down approach

C++  :
======
    object oriented(oops)
    uses only class,object
    bottom up appraoch  
    
OOPs --> solves the real world entity / problems   

characters of oops : 
====================
   1) class  -->blueprint  of object and /template which includes datamembers(variables decalred within class) and member function(function/operation writeen on variables) --advantage -- code reusability
   2)object  --> instance of class //  using of bluepritnt
   3)Data abstraction --> to avoid acces of data // no implemtation
   4)Data hiding --> Data hiding from enduser which is not required
   5)Encapsulation --> combination of data abstraction and hiding // binding insta 
   6)polymorphism -->same name many forms // same method works based on situation
   7)Inhertance --> extending the properties of parent to child class
