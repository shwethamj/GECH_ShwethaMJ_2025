/*
INHERITANCE:
============
      inheriting the properties of parent class to child class
      syntax: 
            class parent{}
            class child : vm(public)parent  

      base class ==> already existing class
      derived class ==> which take properties from base class     
types:
=========
    1) single level
    2) multilevel
    3)multiple
    4)hybrid
    5)hyrarchial

1)single level:
    ==> properties of one parent extends to one child class(one derived class inherit the one base class)
2)multiple
    ==> two base class gives(2 parentclass) the inherit properties to one derived class(grand parent ,parent--child)
3)multilevel
    ==>dervied class inherit the properties of another derived class(grandparent-parent ,parent-child)
4)hybrid
    ==>single base class derived to the  multiple   deriveed class(one parent extends to multiple child class)
5)hyrarchial :
    ==>one parent -- 2 child and that 2 child inherit to 1 grandchild class

 POLYMORPHISM:
===============
    1)compile time --> predifined during compile time it will choose method-->predefined --> method overloding and method overriding
    2)runtime -->after running that will know
