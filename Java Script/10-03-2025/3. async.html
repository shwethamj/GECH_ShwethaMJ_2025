    <h1>Async JS: multithreading engine.. async programming language will be run by the browser</h1>
    <p>Synchronous Code executes line by line, blocking the next operation until the current one finishes.</p>
    <p>Asynchronous JavaScript allows the execution of code without blocking the rest of the program. This means the
        JavaScript engine can handle multiple tasks at the same time, improving efficiency.</p>
    <p>Callbacks (Old way, leads to "callback hell")
        Promises (Modern and readable)
        Async/Await (Best and easiest to use)</p>


    <script>
        console.log("Hello");
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Hello1");
        }, 300000); // using this setTimeOut hello1 will print after 3s the wesite is loaded and only once
        setInterval(() => {
            console.log("Hello123");
        }, 10000) //using this will print hello123 in browser every no of sec we give ,aftter webpage is loaded, this keeps repeating
        console.log("Hello12");
