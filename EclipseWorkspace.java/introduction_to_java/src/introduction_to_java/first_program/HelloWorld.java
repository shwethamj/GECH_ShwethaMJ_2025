	/*STATIC used in main
		* The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) needs to start your program.
		*But it does not create any object of your class.
		*So it needs a method it can call directly, without creating an object.

	STRING[]ARGS
		* String[] → An array of strings
		* args → The name of the array (you can name it anything, like myArgs, but args is common)
		* It helps you pass data into your program when it starts.
		* You can use it to:			
				Pass file names
				Set configuration values				
				Input user data before the program runs
