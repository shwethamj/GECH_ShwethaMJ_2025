		 * extends  the properties of parent class to child class
		 * properties(state and action)
		 
		 * TYPES IN INHERITANCE:
		 
		 * 1.single level => parent to child (only2 classes - inheritance is single level)
		 * ex: child extends parent
		 
		 * 2.multilevel => one child class extends to 2 parent classes one  after another that is
		 *    parent1 extends parent2	
		 *    child extends parent1
		 
		  *3. heirarchial => two childs can extends one parent
		  *ex: child1 extends parent1
		  *    child2 extends parent1
		  
		  *4.hybrid => one child extends from both inteface and a parent class using implements and extends
		  *  child extends parent
		  *  child implements interface
		  
		  *5.Multiple => not possible as java doenot support inhertiance for multiple parents to one child so
		                 we use interface as we learnt previous
